## How to use this repository

---

## Software Requirements

### Julia

xxx

### R

For the empirical part of this course, the free software R is required and can be downloaded [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

Once you have installed the software, open R (e.g., by clicking on it in the list of apps installed on your laptop). Next, run the following code to install a package that is required to run R in Visual Studio Code (see [below](#integrated-development-environment-ide)).

```r
install.packages("languageserver")
```

### Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

We recommend working with an IDE such as Visual Studio Code (VSC) as it offers a wide range of extensions and accommodates most popular programming languages. VSC can be downloaded free of charge [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

While you can also work in [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/) when working with R, the course will be taught using VSC and we encourage you to try it out.

#### VSC Extensions

You can access the extensions menu on the sidebar or via `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux or `⇧⌘X` on macOS. In this menu, you should install the following extensions. You can find them by searching for the extension ID in the extension marketplace.

| Extension | Extension ID | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `R` | `REditorSupport.r` | Make sure you have installed R and the R package `languageserver` (for instructions see [here](https://github.com/REditorSupport/vscode-R.git) or [above](#r)). |
